## Featured Projects

### 6-DOF Robotic Arm

The project describes the design and implementation of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) robotic arm capable of classifying objects based on their color using computer vision. This system integrates tools such as MATLAB, Python, and Arduino, and employs the A* path planning algorithm to optimize movements. It focuses on the efficient detection, classification, and manipulation of objects in real time.
